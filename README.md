# DL related projects: Object Detection
This notebook is the preprocess of the preprocess ingredient in my PhD research project.
In the project, the objective is to develop an automatic toolbox that allow people without engineering background to evaluate the seismic performance of their own property subjected to earthquake.
To achieve the goal of user-friendly and computation-efficiently toolbox, the very first step is to develop the interface that users can easily utilize it.
In this research, both Object Detection and Image Classification are utilize to automatically obtain the parameters that the toolbox need.

Several models are utilized in the training process, which are available from
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md

The training result and the performance are shown in the following images.
